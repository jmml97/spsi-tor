	abstract = {We present Tor, a circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication service. This second-generation Onion Routing system addresses limitations in the original design by adding perfect forward secrecy, congestion control, directory servers, integrity checking, conﬁgurable exit policies, and a practical design for location-hidden services via rendezvous points. Tor works on the real-world Internet, requires no special privileges or kernel modiﬁcations, requires little synchronization or coordination between nodes, and provides a reasonable tradeoff between anonymity, usability, and efﬁciency. We brieﬂy describe our experiences with an international network of more than 30 nodes. We close with a list of open problems in anonymous communication.},

	abstract = {Tor is a popular anonymous Internet communication system, used by an estimated 250,000 users to anonymously exchange over ﬁve terabytes of data per day. The security of Tor depends on properly authenticating nodes to clients, but Tor uses a custom protocol, rather than an established one, to perform this authentication. In this paper, we provide a formal proof of security of this protocol, in the random oracle model, under reasonable cryptographic assumptions.},
