	abstract = {We present Tor, a circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication service. This second-generation Onion Routing system addresses limitations in the original design by adding perfect forward secrecy, congestion control, directory servers, integrity checking, conﬁgurable exit policies, and a practical design for location-hidden services via rendezvous points. Tor works on the real-world Internet, requires no special privileges or kernel modiﬁcations, requires little synchronization or coordination between nodes, and provides a reasonable tradeoff between anonymity, usability, and efﬁciency. We brieﬂy describe our experiences with an international network of more than 30 nodes. We close with a list of open problems in anonymous communication.},
